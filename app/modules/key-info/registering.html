		<h2>Registering</h2>

		<p>If you wish to register with this practice, please bring your medical card to reception. If you are unable to find your medical card, the receptionist will be able to give you appropriate advice.</p>

		<p>As a new patient, you are expected to attend for an introductory medical examination. This is an important consultation that allows us to discuss your past and present medical history, and will ensure that you are receiving the best medical care possible. It is also an opportunity for us to record your medical history onto our computer database and will be used until your proper medical records are received from your previous doctor.</p>

		<p><b>Failure to attend your pre-registration health check, without good reason, may result in you not being accepted onto our list, and if you fail to attend two health check appointments you will not be accepted under any circumstances.</b></p>

		<p><b>Please Note: All patients who fail to keep their appointments will be recorded as 'DNA' (did not attend) and dealt with as necessary.</b></p>
