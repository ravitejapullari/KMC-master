		<p>Appointments for both GP’s are available to book via our clinical system - patient.emisaccess.co.uk (you will require a PIN number to register – please ask at reception).</p>

		<p>There are a number of pre-bookable appointments for both morning and evening sessions which can be booked up to 2 weeks in advance. You can telephone or call in to the surgery at any time to book these.</p>

		<p>We also now offer late evening appointments for those patients who find it difficult to attend during normal surgery hours. These are pre-booked appointments.</p>

		<p>‘On the day’ appointments can be made by telephoning the surgery at 8.00am for the morning surgery ( and some early evening appointments) and 12noon for the evening surgery.</p>

		<h5>The surgery is open Saturday morning from 9.00am for urgent appointments</h5>

					<p>Several appointment slots have been made available to patients who would prefer to book their own GP appointments online. Two appointment slots will be reserved each day in both the morning and afternoon for this purpose. If you wish to use this facility you will need a PIN --- <b>Please ask our reception staff to provide you with a pin number. (Each member of your family will require their own pin number.)</b></p>
					
					<p>To run this facility properly and to avoid disappointment please use the following procedure:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Morning appointments MUST be booked at least 12 hours BEFORE your appointment time.</li>
						<li>Afternoon appointments can be made the same day, BUT NO LATER than midday.</li>
						<li>Any afternoon appointment slots which remain unfilled by 12 noon will be released for general access.</li>

				  <div class="panel-body">
					<p>If you are not calling to request an ‘on the day’ appointment it is better to avoid calling at 8am or 12noon.</p>

					<p>You can call at any time to request a pre-booked appointment for up to 2 weeks in advance.</p>

					<p>For test results please call in an afternoon when lines are less busy.</p>

					<p>For home visits please call before 10.30am. The receptionist will need to ask some details so that the on call GP can prioritise.</p>

					<p>When booking appointments for the nurse the receptionist will ask what it is for. This is so the correct amount of time can be allocated for your appointment. If it is for something personal which you do not wish to disclose to the receptionist just let them know, and no further details will be asked.</p>
