		<h2>Prescriptions</h2>

		<p>When ordering repeat prescriptions, please allow a <b>MINIMUM of 48 hours</b> before collection.</p>

		<p>You may request a repeat prescription:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>By bringing your list of medication (computer print-out attached to your prescription) to Reception. (If you provide a stamped addressed envelope we will be happy to post it to you or you may choose to use the Prescription Collection Service (see below).</li>
			<li>By E-mail using the template provided.</li>
		</ul>	

		<p><b>Please note we have a computerised call and recall system which will ensure you are reminded at regular intervals to attend for a drug review.</b></p>

		<h3>E-Mail Repeat Prescription</h3>
		<p>You may request your repeat prescription through email. Your request will be downloaded twice daily. After 12 noon and after 4.00pm. <b>Please allow 48 hours</b> to process your prescription before collection. You will require a pin number to use this service - please ask reception for further details.</p>

		<h3>Prescription Collection Service</h3>
		<p>At patients' request, many local pharmacies will collect prescriptions from the surgery to save patients the inconvenience of a second visit to the surgery. This will save time for everyone and will ensure that your medication is dispensed and waiting for you when you go to collect it. If you would like to use this service, please let our receptionists know which chemist you would like to use, so that we can record this information.</p>

		<p>Due to circumstances beyond our control we are now unable to send repeat prescriptions straight to the chemist of your choice. In future you will be responsible for ringing the relevant chemist and advising them that a prescription will be waiting at the surgery for pick-up the following day. They will then collect the prescription from the surgery.</p>

		<p><b>This service does not affect your right to pick up your prescription personally. 48 hours' notice is still required.</b></p>
