		<h2>GP2GP</h2>
		<h5>Here at Kingsfold Medical Centre we utilise an electronic system for transferring patient records to and from other GP surgeries called GP2GP.</h5>

		<p>GP2GP enables patients' electronic health records to be transferred directly and securely between GP practices. It improves patient care as GPs will usually have full and detailed medical records available to them for a new patient's first consultation.</p>
		<h5>Why itâ€™s needed </h5>
		<p>GP2GP is the project that enables patients' electronic health records (EHRs) to be transferred directly from one practice to another.</p>

		<p>GP2GP starts when a practice accepts a patient onto their list of patients for primary health care and ends when the EHR is transferred from the previous practice into the new GP clinical system.</p>

		<p>GP2GP electronic transfers will be more accurate and secure - and much faster than the current paper-based approach, which can take weeks to complete.</p>

		<h5>Background to GP2GP</h5>

		<p>There are some 9,000 GP practices in England. They each currently deal with an average 500 patient record transfers each year. Inner city and university practices deal with far more.<p>

		<p>The process involves:<p>

		<ul>
			<li>Printing out the details of the patient health record held on the GP clinical system and then putting that print-out into the patient's 'Lloyd George' envelope, together with any historical paper records, laboratory forms, hospital referral letters and the letters that result from that referral.</li>

			<li>These documents are then transferred to the new practice via the local medical records transfer process.
			Upon receipt of the Lloyd George, the new practice reviews the information received, summarises the record and enters any appropriate information into their GP clinical system.</li>

			<li>The time it takes to receive a patient record from the time it is requested can be anything from a few weeks to a few months. As a result, the new practice often does not have the benefit of the old record when the patient attends for the first consultation. Once received, it can be very time-consuming for the new practice to key in the summary of the record into its own clinical system.</li>
		</ul>	

		<p>GP2GP, on the other hand, enables an almost instantaneous transfer of a patient's EHR. As a result, GPs and their teams will be able to provide patients with a safer and more efficient service. Read more about the benefits of GP2GP.<p>
