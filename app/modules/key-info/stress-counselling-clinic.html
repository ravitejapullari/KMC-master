		<h2>Stress Counselling Clinic</h2>
		<p>The Chorley & South Ribble CCG provides a comprehensive Counselling Service. If you feel you need to see a counsellor please contact your Doctor who will be happy to refer you.</p>

    <p>The Chorley & South Ribble CCG makes these appointments and therefore Kingsfold staff are unable to access these appointments directly from the surgery.</p>
    
    <h3>What is... Counselling?</h3>
    <p>Counselling is a private and confidential service.</p>

    <p>Counselling is a joint process in which the counsellor and the client work together. It is not a quick and easy solution to lifeâ€™s problems. Through counselling people can learn to understand themselves and their life situations more clearly and begin to make decisions about achieving a more satisfying life.</p>

    <p>Our in-house counsellor is highly trained to deal with a wide variety of problems including: depression, anxiety, marriage or relationship difficulties, crisis of confidence and bereavement.</p>

    <p>At your first meeting the counsellor will listen to your problems, and explore ways to help you start achieving a more satisfying life. She will also discuss with you what help you need and whether she feels she can offer you this. If you both decide counselling will be of help, she will arrange to see you for an agreed number of sessions, each one lasting for approximately 50 minutes. Each person needs a varying number of sessions, some more, some less. Individual needs will be reviewed as the counselling progresses.</p>

    <p>Counselling cannot solve all our problems and is not always the most suitable form of help, but many people have nevertheless found it a great help.</p>
		
    <h3>What you can expect from us</h3>
    <p>We will offer your first appointment as quickly as we can; if, at the end of this appointment, it is agreed the counsellor may be able to help you, she will outline the times and number of sessions you will be expected to attend.</p>

    <h3>What we expect from you</h3>
    <p>Once counselling begins, you will be expected to keep your appointments.</p>

    <p>If you do need to cancel an appointment, please let us know as soon as possible, so that we can arrange to see someone else. The counsellor will offer you another appointment, but regrets that if you cancel too many times you may not be offered a further session.</p>

    <p>If you wish to stop your treatment at any time, you may do so by informing the counsellor. If you wish to have a relative or friend with you during the counselling session, please discuss this with the counsellor prior to your appointment time.</p>
