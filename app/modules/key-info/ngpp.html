		<h2>Named GP For All Patients</h2>
		<p>The practice is required by the Government under the terms of the latest GP contract to allocate all patients a named accountable GP.</p>

		<p>Individual patients will be informed of their named accountable GP at the first appropriate interaction with the practice.</p>

		<p>For convenience, if you have a medical card your Accountable GP will be the named doctor you are registered with. Patients registering over the last 2-3 years will not have received a medical card as these are no longer routinely sent when registering with a new GP.</p>

		<p>However, the practice does keep a record of your registered (accountable) GP. If you wish to be told the name of your Accountable GP please ask the receptionists when you are next in surgery.</p>

		<p>Please note: there is no need to telephone the practice for this information.</p>

		<p>Where a patient expresses a preference as to which GP they have been assigned, the practice will make reasonable efforts to accommodate this request.</p>

		<p>Having a named GP does not prevent you seeing any other doctor in the practice. Your named GP will not be available at all times and if your needs are urgent you may need to discuss them with an alternative doctor.</p>
