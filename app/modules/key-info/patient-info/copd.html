		<h2>COPD</h2>
		<p><b>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</b> is a descriptive medical term for a number of similar overlapping diseases that include chronic bronchitis, emphysema and some chronic asthma that has become resistant to treatment. These conditions have in common a persistent and slowly progressive pattern of symptoms such as shortness of breath, cough and wheeze. In particular, on formal measurement they all share reduced flow of air through the bronchial tubes, due to narrowing or damage.</p>

		<p>Chronic bronchitis means having a cough with sputum for at least three months a year for two consecutive years. In its mildest form this could simply be a smokerâ€™s cough in the morning with small amounts of sputum. Severe chronic bronchitis, on the other hand, involves a much greater degree of cough and sputum linked with shortness of breath, wheeze and frequent episodes of Acute bronchitis, especially during the winter months. Chronic bronchitis relates to producing excess amounts of phlegm with narrowing of breathing tubes.</p>

		<p>Emphysema can be more difficult to diagnose clinically until more advanced. The symptoms are shortness of breath with wheeze and chest tightness. They are caused by permanent damage to the small breathing tubes and air sacs where oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged with the blood.</p>

		<p>Chronic bronchitis and emphysema often occur in the same patient. Both conditions tend to start after the age of 50 and are more common in men than women.</p>
