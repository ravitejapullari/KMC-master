		<h2>Eczema</h2>
		<p>Eczema is the most common skin condition: it affects all ages and both sexes. The words eczema and dermatitis can mean the same thing and are used to describe a condition in which the skin becomes inflamed, itchy, dry and scaly. The appearance of eczema can vary from person to person, and can affect different parts of the body. It can be a long term condition or a sudden outbreak.</p>
		
		<h3>What causes eczema?</h3>

In people with eczema the skin does not perform this role effectively. Moisture is lost, resulting in a dry, cracked, scaly appearance. These cracks then allow irritants, allergens and bacteria to penetrate, causing an allergic reaction.</p>
