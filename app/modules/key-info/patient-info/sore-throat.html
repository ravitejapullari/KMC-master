		<h2>Sore Throat</h2>

		<p>A sore throat is a very common ailment that affects all ages but is more common in children and young adults.</p>

		<p>Symptoms of a viral sore throat can include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A worsening soreness in the throat - often at its worst after 2 to 3 days.</li>
			<li>Swallowing is unpleasant and as the soreness in the throat worsens, cold symptoms, hoarse voice, or mild cough may develop.</li>
			<li>The glands in the neck may swell (fighting off the virus).</li>
			<li>Symptoms get worse for 2 to 3 days then get better usually within a week.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Symptoms of tonsillitis are similar, but often worse:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The raised temperature and general feeling of being unwell tends to be worse.</li>
			<li>The neck glands tend to be bigger and more painful.</li>
			<li>Pus can often be seen on the swollen, red tonsils.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>What can I do?</h3>
		<p>If your doctor has decided not to prescribe antibiotics it is because you have a viral sore throat and, taking antibiotics will not help, however, you should:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Drink plenty of fluid, even if it is a little painful, it is a good idea. Not drinking, together with a fever can cause dehydration which can make tiredness and headaches worse.</li>
			<li>Take regular Paracetamol to ease pain, headache and bring the temperature down. You can obtain soluble Paracetamol tablets of, for children use Paracetamol liquid.</li>
			<li>In addition to Paracetamol, adults may find that gargling with soluble Aspirin (dissolved in water) for 3 or 4 minutes often eases soreness and pain. This is often of mostly benefit before meals and at bedtime.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Aspirin however, should not be given to children under 12 and also not to people taking other painkillers and medicines for stomach and joint problems.</p>

		<p>Your local pharmacist can advise you on which product to use to give relief of your symptoms. Always be sure to tell the pharmacist if you are taking other medication.</p>

		<p>If, following the advice above, your symptoms are eased then you should begin to feel better within 3 to 4 days.</p>

		<p>However, if you do not start to feel better after a few days or you feel worse or have any unusual symptoms, please do go back to see your doctor for more advice.</p>
