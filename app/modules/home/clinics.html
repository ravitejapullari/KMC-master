    <p>Various clinics are held each week that are run by the Doctors and Practice Nurses. During these clinics patients' weight, height, blood pressure, urine tests are carried out. The clinics provide an ideal opportunity to discuss alcohol consumption, diet and exercise. We also take cervical smears, do breast checks and teach breast self-examination techniques.</p>
    <p>Those patients who are on regular treatment for blood pressure, asthma or diabetes are reviewed every few months to discuss their treatment. We are a fully computerised practice and have an excellent recall system through which we monitor and invite patients to attend as and when appropriate.</p>
